# Ginger

Ginger is a programming language I am developing as part of my PhD research into information flow control. I am using this project as a learning tool to better understand the process of how 'program code' becomes a program.

## Goals

* Compilation using the LLVM

## Status

Ginger is in early development. It has very few keywords, does not create a complete AST and is not able to be compiled.
